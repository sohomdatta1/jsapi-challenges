# js-api Challenges

This repository hosts a copy of the source codes, challenge description and bot infra for the challenges written by me for niteCTF 2022. The challenges are xs-leak based web challenges.

I'll be writing a official writeup for these soon(TM).

> *NOTE*: niteCTF servers are offline, however, I have no intention of taking down the two challenge websites (https://challenge.jsapi.tech and https://chall1.jsapi.tech) or the related DNS entries. Feel free to use these domains if you are specifically intrested in following along with the writeups or solving the challenge locally.
