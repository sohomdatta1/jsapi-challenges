# undocumented js-api

I asked my web developer friend to create a secure app for storing my HTML notes, but he left halfway through the project. If you find any bugs in the app, just report it to me at netcat url

Inspired from arxenix#1337's yana challenge in UIUCTF

The fact that no-one has been able to solve this challenge is beautiful :)

Also, maybe DOMPurify documentation can help, oh wait it's undocumented ?
